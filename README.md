DrawingGUI is a basic java GUI that lets the user paint on a canvas using a multitude of colors. 

To draw, use the arrow keys (LEFT), (RIGHT), (UP), and (DOWN).

To change the color from black, press F1 to switch to blue, press F2 to switch to red, press F3 to switch to green, and F4 to switch back to black.

Have fun with this little project, as it can be used to teach intermediate java developers how a GUI works and its working components!
